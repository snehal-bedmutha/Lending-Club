Loans are the major source of incomes for business and financial institutions and we thought it would be a thoughtful to provide some way to identify the quality of a sanctioned loan.
In this project, we aim at identifying loans as good loan or bad loan based on the basis of  parameters provided in the data set. After performing some exploratory analysis on the data we could clearly note that there are some distinct parameters that differentiate good loans from bad loans.
